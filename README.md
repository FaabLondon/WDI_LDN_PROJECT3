### Overview

For our third project we were instructed to build a full-stack MEAN application. This was required to use Mongo, Node, Angular and Express. This incorporated an API with 2 related models, RESTFUL actions, automated tests using Mocha and Chai and was styled using Bulma.



### Make my day

Our application is a day trip planner which allows users to create a customised itinerary based on the location of their trip. Users can create a new trip with the date and city location and the app returns a results based on their search. The in-built map displays markers with locations of points of interest, which can then be filtered by search category. The user adds places to their day trip which then allows them to view a route with directions and timings. They can also make multiple day trips for different locations which they can refer to at any time.

#### Planning


We used agile methodology during the planning phase of the project. We created a Trello board, specifying our MVP requirements, nice-to-have features and stretch goals. Tasks were assigned to members of the group throughout the project using this system. We used Github to collaborate making use of branches and checking for merge conflicts.

We then wireframed our website design.

The user is directed to a registration/login page on page load which upon completion takes them to the create a trip page. This requests the user to enter their trip location which uses Google autocomplete to store their 

#### Client-side

* **Use Angular** to build a front-end that consumes your API
* **Use SCSS instead of CSS**
* **Use Webpack & Yarn** to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade Angular front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
	* Explanations of the **technologies** used
   	* A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   	* **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   	* Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_
